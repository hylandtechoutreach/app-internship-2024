# Team Workflow
When you're developing features or fixing bugs for the project, you'll want to follow the [trunk-based development workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development). A big piece of this will be working together to be as successful as possible.

## During Active Development
When the team is up and running, some processes should be followed.

### Programming Together
You are encouraged to practice [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) throughout their workdays. You could even try [mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) if you'd like. Pair programming will help you:

- Learn more about the codebase
- Assure quality of the code written
- Impart wisdom and insights you may have
- Get to know your team members better
- Maintain the codebase effectively

If you are _not_ pair programming, you will need to make sure the whole team understands the code you are writing.

### Issues
Issues will be tracked using the repository's [project](https://github.com/orgs/hto-projects/projects/5) in GitHub. This board is the place to see who's working on what. You're welcome to create your own issues, but everything you do in the codebase should be tied to an issue. You are also welcome to assign yourselves issues as a team.

### Working on an Issue
The basic process to follow when you're starting work on an issue is as follows:

- Move the issue to the "In Progress" column
- Make sure you are assigned to the issue
- Create a feature branch off the **main** branch, attached to the issue
- Pull the latest code for your feature branch locally
- Do your development work locally
- Make sure to merge in any current changes from the **main** branch into your feature branch
- Continue development until your issue is ready for review
- Push your changes up to your remote feature branch
- Submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for your issue
- Have at least one other intern complete a [code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review)
- If the code is good to go:  
    - The other intern should approve & merge it into the **main branch**
- Otherwise:  
    - You can continue development on the feature branch
    
Please leverage your fellow interns as you do your development - and leverage your mentors as well!

## Autonomy
It will be up to you, as a team, to complete the necessary work for this project. Ideally, you will be fully autonomous; self-governing, without the need for any overarching authority. There will be some structures in place to help you function to the best of your ability, but ultimately, your success is up to you. You, as a team, have the power to dictate the vision and determine the path forward for the project. The job of the Hyland leads and mentors is simply to provide you the best available space to make your team dreams come true.
