# Roles & Facilitation
In order to provide the interns with a fun, valuable, and impactful experience, team members from Hyland will perform various functions.

## Role Descriptions
The team of Hylanders will be split into three primary roles:

### Lead
The lead is ultimately responsible for the intern team. They:

- Act as the "go-to" person for the team
- Make decisions about the direction of the project
- Hold ultimate power over the codebase

This includes:

- Sitting in close proximity to the intern team
- Providing the first line of assistance when interns need help
- Reaching out the check on the interns regularly, even if they do not ask for help
- Developing features or fixing bugs alongside the interns
- Creating issues on the board and prioritizing the backlog
- Performing code reviews
- Running team meetings
- Assigning issues to individual interns
- Being "on-call" for the interns during their working hours
- Reaching out to other Hylanders for coverage when needed
- Calling ad-hoc meetings with the team as needed
- Performing individual check-ins with each intern (not one-on-one, need another adult)

Overall, the lead is the primary point person for the project.

### Mentor
Mentors provide technical guidance to the team as needed. It is not necessarily _assumed_ that a mentor will be present at any particular point, but they are always welcome and encouraged to be as involved as possible. This may include:

- Attending team meetings
- Providing assistance with coding or debugging
- Sitting in close proximity to the intern team
- Developing features or fixing bugs alongside the interns
- Creating issues on the board
- Performing code reviews

Each mentor is a blessing unto us, and we thank them with our eternal gratitude 🙏

### Facilitator
Facilitators provide supervision, non-technical guidance, and moral support to the team as needed. Facilitators may be assigned to look after the interns during particular time blocks, or they may assist the team in an ad-hoc capacity. Facilitators may:

- Join team building and culture building activities
- Attend/lead non-technical team meetings
- Sit in close proximity to the intern team
- Provide support for work experience (e.g., creating IS Work orders, encouraging camaraderie)

Overall, facilitators help provide a welcoming, meaningful work experience for the interns beyond the technical side. However, **nothing they do is _mandatory_ unless they are assigned something in particular.**

## Daily Activities
Every day the team is working, each role will participate in some key activities to help ensure the internship is a positive experience.

### Lead
The lead will:

- Check in with the intern team at least once per hour
- Facilitate the stand-up meeting
  - And any additional meetings for the day
- Encourage camaraderie amongst the team
  - Structured activities like [Gartic Phone](https://garticphone.com/), [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/), [Gimkit](https://www.gimkit.com/)
  - Unstructured activities like friendly debates (is water wet, is a hot dog a sandwich, etc)
  - Generally, getting to know each individual intern
- Maintain the board
  - Ensure each intern is working on at least one ticket, or learning
- Check email and Teams for messages from the interns
  - Especially if they are working remotely
- Actively pull down the latest version of the codebase locally
  - Pull down code multiple times per day if needed
  - Ensure the project runs successfully
- Try to close out (or at least comment on) each PR by the end of the day

### Mentor
Mentors will:

- Assist with questions as they arise (on Teams or in-person)
- Actively aid in development of the project (if desired)
- Help with any assigned coverage

### Facilitator
Facilitators will:

- Provide availability if they are able
- Help with any assigned coverage

## Weekly Activities
Some things will be required on a weekly (or bi-weekly) basis.

### Lead
The lead will:

- Keep tabs on interns who are working remotely or off-hours
- Create a plan and goal(s) for each week
  - Some of these have already been created, but should always be reassessed
  - Each plan should be effectively communicated to the team
- Maintain the schedule of intern working hours on a per-week basis
  - Check with each intern, make sure they provide up-to-date availability
- Welcome interns on their first day of the week
- Bid a fond farewell to interns on their last day of the week
- Try to ensure a successful build by the end of each week

### Mentor
Mentors can:

- Check in at the beginning of the week to see how things are looking
- Provide weekly availability to help with the project
- Pull code to ensure they are well-suited to help with development
- Take a look at pull requests, issues, and other project information

### Facilitator
Facilitators can:

- Check in at the beginning of the week to see how things are looking
- Provide weekly availability to help with te project

## Conclusion
Ultimately, each team member can play a part in the success of this internship. I (Joseph) will obviously be gone for a large chunk of it, but I really hope it will continue without too many hiccups.

My hope is that the intern team will be largely autonomous by the time I depart. If that is the case, they can be largely left to their own devices. The main role, shared by all Hylanders who are assisting with this project, is to give them the space to create their _own_ experience, and support them as they do their best to make it a positive, educational, and meaningful one.
