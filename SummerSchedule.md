## Week 1: 6/16-6-22

- Tuesday, 7/2: Playtesting 2-3pm

## Week 9: 8/11-8/17*
The goal for this week, depending on school schedules, is to finish the internship strong.

## Week 10: 8/18-8/24
Depending on school schedules, there may be one last week before the end of the summer - if the final demo has not happened, this will be a good time for that. Otherwise, it could be an opportunity for interns to get a few more hours. Or, if all the interns have reached their work quota, this week may not contain anything at all!
