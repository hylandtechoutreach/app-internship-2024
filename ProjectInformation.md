# AUTOHACK IDLE
_an incremental game for lazy coders_

## Description
This application will help students learn to code while providing a fun and engaging game experience. Taking inspiration from incremental games like [Cookie Clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker), [AdVenture Capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdVenture_Capitalist), [Idle Slayer](https://idleslayer.com/), and [Candy Box](https://candybox2.github.io/candybox/), the game will encourage players to return on a regular basis to build up their hoard of data AND their programming acumen. They will learn about computer science without even realizing it - through puzzles, mini-games, achievements, and challenges.

### Why an Idle Game?
Essentially, [people like when number go bigger](https://fictiontalk.com/2021/08/25/the-psychology-of-idle-games-why-humans-like-big-numbers/). This will hopefully keep players invested, and make them want to level up their coding skills.

## Gameplay
The goal of the game is to collect as much _data_ as possible. Initially, this will happen by tapping `1`s and `0`s as they randomly appear on a screen - kind of like [Whac-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole). As the game progresses, players will be able to "hack" the data collection process to automatically collect data, enhance their data storage, and more - all through coding. Players will also be able to _sell_ their data to receive currency. This currency can be used to purchase upgrades: making bits appear more frequently, checking for bits more frequently, superpowers like data magnets, increasing the value of each collected chunk, or AI.

All of the basic gameplay will be possible without signing in or storing data in a database. This will allow anyone to start playing very quickly, and even play offline - their game data will be stored in the browser local storage.

### Accounts: Collectible Items
There will also be an option to create an account. This will allow for cloud saves, and, most importantly, the appearance of collectible items. These items (like [Blooks](https://blooket.fandom.com/wiki/Blooks)) will have a cool name. They will:

- Appear randomly
- Appear only when connected to the server with an account  
    - Except for the first one, which is only collectible with an account
- Be showcased and traded
- Have different levels of rarity
- Be awarded for some achievements
- Sometimes join together to unlock the final form (like [Exodia from Yu-Gi-Oh!](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Forbidden_One))
- Be available from purchaseable random boxes (using in-game currency)
- Regularly provide new releases to promote sustainability/long-term play

This will provide an opportunity for players to connect and interact.

### Learning Journeys
There will be various ways to learn and practice computer science skills within the game.

- There may be instructional lesson videos (edutainment)
- There may be puzzles (drag code to the right place)
- All of the learning will be available offline
- There will be some collectibles only available through the learning (must be registered)

The learning is the primary purpose of the application; however, it should never take away from the players' enjoyment of the game.

### Creativity
There will be several opportunities for creativity during this project. Many aspects exist beyond the actual coding:

- Art
- Music
- Game Design
- User Experience
- Marketing

Ultimately, the vision for the game will be determined by the intern team.

## GitHub
The codebase is stored in this GitHub Repository:  
[https://github.com/hto-projects/autohack-idle](https://github.com/hto-projects/autohack-idle)

Issues will be tracked in this GitHub Project:  
[https://github.com/orgs/hto-projects/projects/5/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/hto-projects/projects/5/views/1)

## Current State
Currently, the game does not do much. There is a lot of work to be done.

The deployed application is hosted [on render](https://autohack-idle.onrender.com/).
